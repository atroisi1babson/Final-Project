# Final Project
 
## Team Members:
1. Alex Troisi

## Possible Ideas:
- Revamp recall alert website (nonprofit owned by family, I have full access) using ChatGPT API to create summaries of recalls as weekly news articles. Possibly generate images for individual recalls. Many small things that could be fixed. Would be able to spend money for certain APIs and publish changes to the website.
- Automate audit processes. May not be feasible due for class due confidentiality reasons because of inadvertently disclosing vendors, etc... I will do plenty of this in my full-time job regardless.
- Mesh several real estate APIs together to help me understand where to purchase a home. Very likely to include financial analyses analyzing particular neighborhoods and projected rental incomes of properties etc...
